            <img src="\img\project1.jpg" alt="Project 1" class="project-image">     

            <p class="project-description">Developed a portable weather station using an Arduino UNO as the project's central controller, aiming to create a compact, accessible device capable of monitoring local environmental conditions. The weather station collects data from multiple sensors, including an AM2302 (DHT22) sensor for temperature and humidity readings, and a DPS310 sensor for barometric pressure. These sensors were chosen for their precision, durability, and ease of integration with the Arduino platform. My objective was to create a reliable system that could provide real-time data on temperature, humidity, and pressure, displaying the results directly on a 4x4 LCD screen, making it user-friendly and suitable for quick weather assessments in various settings.

            The project began with coding the Arduino in the Arduino IDE to establish connections and communication between the sensors and the display. I programmed the device to retrieve data at regular intervals and then refresh the screen with the latest values. This required an understanding of the I2C communication protocol for the DPS310 sensor and a direct digital pin connection for the AM2302, as each sensor had unique communication requirements. The AM2302 provided temperature and humidity data in a digital format, allowing for accurate readings over a wide range of environmental conditions, while the DPS310, a highly sensitive barometric pressure sensor, provided altitude data derived from pressure measurements. 
                
            In terms of future improvements, I am exploring options for wireless data transmission, potentially by integrating a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module. This would allow the station to transmit data to a mobile device or cloud platform for remote monitoring and data logging over extended periods. I'm also considering implementing an SD card module for local data storage, enabling historical data tracking. Additionally, I aim to enhance power efficiency by experimenting with low-power mode configurations for the Arduino and sensors, extending battery life for field applications. These potential upgrades would not only improve the device's functionality and usability but also expand its applicability to a wider range of users, from hobbyists and students to researchers in need of reliable, portable environmental monitoring tools.</p>

            <p class="project-description">I developed a robotic system using the iRobot Create3 platform, designed with two primary capabilities: autonomous maze-solving and automated delivery navigation. These features were implemented to demonstrate the robot's versatility in handling complex tasks independently, including navigating a maze and delivering items to specific locations, while ensuring collision-free operation.

            The first functionality, the maze-solving feature, involved programming the robot to explore and exit a maze without external assistance. To achieve this, I implemented a recursive algorithm that allowed the robot to systematically explore unknown pathways and track its movements. Using this approach, the robot could recognize dead ends and backtrack to attempt alternative routes, methodically traversing every part of the maze until it located the exit. I programmed the maze exploration algorithm in Python, utilizing a depth-first search technique that allowed the robot to “remember” its path and effectively handle random maze structures. The system also incorporated infrared and touch sensors to detect walls and obstacles, enabling the robot to avoid collisions and maintain a steady exploration path. This maze-solving capability demonstrated the robot's ability to adaptively map out an unknown environment, relying on a recursive strategy that was both efficient and self-contained.

            The second functionality, autonomous delivery, was designed to enable the robot to transport items to specific destinations within a predefined environment, such as a mapped indoor area. For this feature, I integrated a waypoint-based navigation system that allowed the robot to reach designated delivery points accurately. Unlike the maze-solving functionality, which required a dynamic response to unknown pathways, the delivery feature operated within a known environment where target locations were predetermined and stored within the robot's memory. The system combined location data from the robot's internal sensors with a pre-programmed map to navigate efficiently between points. Once at a designated drop-off location, the robot could deposit an item and proceed to the next destination, or return to a base point. This feature highlighted the robot's capability for practical applications, such as small-scale indoor deliveries.

            The collision protection was a key aspect of both functionalities, ensuring safe navigation in varied environments. The infrared sensors continuously scanned the surroundings to prevent collisions, while touch sensors provided an additional layer of protection in case of close contact with obstacles. This multi-sensor setup proved effective in both the maze-solving and delivery tasks, allowing the robot to operate autonomously without the risk of damage from environmental collisions.

            The project was a success, showcasing the potential of the iRobot Create3 platform to handle distinct tasks autonomously and efficiently. The maze-solving algorithm effectively guided the robot through complex pathways, while the delivery system reliably navigated to specific destinations. Feedback from instructors emphasized the project's practical value and the strong integration of programming and embedded system skills.

            Looking forward, I plan to improve the system by incorporating machine learning to optimize route selection, especially for the delivery function, enabling the robot to learn from previous runs and adjust its path dynamically. I also hope to integrate additional sensors, such as LiDAR, for more precise environmental mapping, enhancing the robot's efficiency in complex or larger-scale environments. These improvements would further elevate the robot's capabilities and broaden its real-world applications.</p>
