            <img src="\img\project1.jpg" alt="Project 1" class="project-image">
            <p class="project-description">Developed a portable weather station using an Arduino UNO. Programmed the the Arduino to collect the data from the temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors (AM2302 and DPS310) and display it in a LCD screen.</p>
            <p class="project-description">Skills: Circuit desing, Programming, Circuit assembling.</p>
            <p class="project-description">I developed a portable weather station using an Arduino UNO as the project's central controller, aiming to create a compact, accessible device capable of monitoring local environmental conditions. The weather station collects data from multiple sensors, including an AM2302 (DHT22) sensor for temperature and humidity readings, and a DPS310 sensor for barometric pressure. These sensors were chosen for their precision, durability, and ease of integration with the Arduino platform. My objective was to create a reliable system that could provide real-time data on temperature, humidity, and pressure, displaying the results directly on a 16x2 LCD screen, making it user-friendly and suitable for quick weather assessments in various settings.

                The project began with coding the Arduino in the Arduino IDE to establish connections and communication between the sensors and the display. I programmed the device to retrieve data at regular intervals and then refresh the screen with the latest values. This required an understanding of the I2C communication protocol for the DPS310 sensor and a direct digital pin connection for the AM2302, as each sensor had unique communication requirements. The AM2302 provided temperature and humidity data in a digital format, allowing for accurate readings over a wide range of environmental conditions, while the DPS310, a highly sensitive barometric pressure sensor, provided altitude data derived from pressure measurements. Integrating these sensors required careful timing and sequencing to avoid data overlap or miscommunication errors within the program.
                
                In terms of future improvements, I am exploring options for wireless data transmission, potentially by integrating a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module. This would allow the station to transmit data to a mobile device or cloud platform for remote monitoring and data logging over extended periods. I'm also considering implementing an SD card module for local data storage, enabling historical data tracking. Additionally, I aim to enhance power efficiency by experimenting with low-power mode configurations for the Arduino and sensors, extending battery life for field applications. These potential upgrades would not only improve the device's functionality and usability but also expand its applicability to a wider range of users, from hobbyists and students to researchers in need of reliable, portable environmental monitoring tools.</p>
