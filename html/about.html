            <h2>Trajectory</h2>

            <p class="traj-p">From gazing at the stars to exploring circuits and computers, my journey has been fueled by an insatiable curiosity. I grew up in a small town in Brazil, where the night sky became a familiar sight. Every evening, whether with family, friends, or on my own, I would find myself captivated by the vastness of the universe above. Observing the stars was more than a pastime—it sparked a fascination with understanding the natural world. At school, my interest only deepened as physics and astronomy began to provide answers. Science soon became my language, helping me make sense of everyday wonders, and curiosity became my guide.</p>
            <p class="traj-p">Driven by this curiosity, I took part in various science olympiads—competitions that not only fueled my interest but also challenged me to sharpen my logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and time and stress management skills. These events offered me the thrill of competing while diving deeper into scientific concepts, and I even had the honor of participating in the preliminary stages of the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics. Each experience taught me to approach problems methodically and think critically, laying a solid foundation for future pursuits.</p>
            <p class="traj-p">At the same time, these experiences have allowed me to experience one of the greatest learning moments I've ever had: teaching other people. During high school, I gave lessons to my classmates who were also passionate about astronomy and wanted, like me, to compete in an international competition. By preparing the lessons and answering questions, I gradually understood that teaching is the most efficient way to learn.</p>
            <p class="traj-p">As time passed, my interests evolved and broadened. I found myself increasingly drawn to the world of robotics and computer science. My curiosity shifted from understanding the universe to actively creating within it—from observing and explaining to designing and building. Through robotics and programming, I started tackling real-world problems, applying my skills to develop tangible solutions to issues I encountered in everyday life.</p>
            <p class="traj-p">Today, that same curiosity drives me forward. I channel it into technology competitions and hackathons, where I push myself to build innovative tools and solutions. From mobile app development to machine learning projects, these events allow me to explore new technologies and apply my knowledge creatively in a collaborative, competitive environment.</p>
            <p class="traj-p">In my quest for broader horizons, I chose to attend college in Atlanta, Georgia, joining the dynamic community at Georgia Tech. Here, I`ve found a place where I am constantly inspired and challenged to grow. Surrounded by like-minded individuals, I am encouraged every day to continue exploring, learning, and developing solutions that make a real difference.</p>

            <h2>Career Goals</h2>

            <p>In the future, I plan to explore how computer engineering can support the sustainable development of technologies like machine learning and AI. Throughout my degree, I will use the knowledge that will be constructed through my threads, Computing Hardware & Emerging Architectures and Systems & Architecture, to develop innovative processor architectures that combine energy efficiency with high performance. After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering to deepen my expertise in processor design, ultimately preparing me to create architectures that advance technology responsibly and sustainably. Through all this academic training, I also aim to return to the place where I grew up, and encourage technological development in my country, through projects to stimulate and teach technology.</p>
