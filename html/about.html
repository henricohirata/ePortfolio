            <h2>Trajectory</h2>
            <p>From stars to circuits and computers. I was born in a small town in Brazil, and throughout my childhood, observing the sky and the stars was a daily activity. Accompanied by my family, friends or even alone, I loved to spend my evenings contemplating the beauty of the universe. At school, physics and astronomy gave me answers and I began to explain everyday issues through science. Curiosity drove me.</p>
            <p>Curiosity led me to take part in science olympiads, competitions in which I could develop my logical thinking, problem solving, time and stress management. I even had the opportunity to compete in the preliminary stages of the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>
            <p>Over time, my interests became more and more diverse, and I began to explore the world of robotics and computers. Now, I was not only trying to understand the world and the things around me, but also to develop solutions to the problems I encountered on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, I try to apply the curiosity that led me to question the things around me to develop solutions to the problems I face. In the same competitive spirit, I love getting involved in hackathons and technology competitions, where I've been able to develop tools with machine learning and mobile programming.</p>
